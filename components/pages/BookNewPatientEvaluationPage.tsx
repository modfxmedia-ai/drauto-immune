const FAQ_ITEMS: FaqItem[] = [
  {
    question: "What makes this evaluation different from a typical doctor visit?",
    answer: [
      "Most traditional visits are brief and focused on individual symptoms. Our process is designed to take a broader, more personalized look at your health by exploring how different systems in the body may be connected and where deeper imbalances may be contributing to what you are experiencing.",
      "During your New Patient Evaluation, our team reviews your health history, current symptoms, and comprehensive bloodwork to uncover patterns that may be missed when concerns are looked at one at a time. Your evaluation follows a clinical framework developed by Dr. Ian, with our care team guiding you through each step.",
      "Rather than focusing only on short term symptom management, this evaluation is designed to create a clearer, more complete picture of your health so you can better understand what may be driving your symptoms and what the next steps may be.",
    ],
  },
  {
    question: "Where do appointments take place?",
    answer: [
      "All appointments are completed virtually through secure telehealth. You can meet with our care team from anywhere in the United States, right from the comfort and privacy of your home.",
    ],
  },
  {
    question: "How do I complete my blood work?",
    answer: [
      "During your Discovery Call, our coordinator will guide you through the setup process. They will help you schedule your blood draw at a LabCorp location that is convenient for you and provide your new patient paperwork to complete in advance.",
      "This paperwork allows our team to understand your health history, symptoms, and timeline ahead of time so your evaluation can be focused, personalized, and productive.",
      "Once your bloodwork is complete, your results are securely uploaded to your patient portal and prepared for review as part of your New Patient Evaluation.",
    ],
  },
  {
    question: "Is this covered by insurance?",
    answer: [
      "Functional medicine is not typically covered by insurance because it focuses on a deeper, more comprehensive level of evaluation and care than standard medical visits. We recognize that investing in your health is a significant decision, and we are committed to making this process as accessible as possible.",
      "Many patients use HSA or FSA funds for the exam and labs, and we also partner with Care Credit and Affirm to offer flexible financing options. Our team will work with you to find a plan that fits your budget and timeline.",
      "When considering cost, it can help to think about what it takes to stay unwell — time, frustration, missed opportunities, and uncertainty. Our goal is to help you gain clarity and direction so you can make informed choices that truly support your well-being.",
    ],
  },
  {
    question: "What happens after my evaluation?",
    answer: [
      "At the end of your evaluation, our team will walk you through a personalized care plan based on your results, symptoms, and goals. You will leave with clear next steps, supportive guidance, and a better understanding of what your body may need so you are not left guessing about what to do next.",
      "Many patients choose to continue with one of our structured programs because they want consistent direction, support, and accountability as they begin applying their plan. These programs provide step by step guidance, educational resources, and ongoing communication with our team.",
      "You are always in control of your pace and your path, but for those ready to continue, your plan becomes a clear roadmap forward and a reminder that there is a path toward feeling better.",
    ],
  },
  {
    question: "What if I need to reschedule?",
    answer: ["We understand that life happens. Simply contact our coordinator at least 24 hours in advance and we will find a new time that works for you."],
  },
  {
    question: "What if I still have questions?",
    answer: [
      "We are here for you. Our team is happy to answer any questions you have before or after your Discovery Call. You can reach us at npc@drautoimmune.com, and a member of our team will respond as soon as possible.",

                  Most of our patients come to us after years of frustration. They&rsquo;ve seen multiple providers,
                  tried medications and diets, yet still don&rsquo;t feel like themselves.
                </p>
                <p>That&rsquo;s where functional medicine is different.</p>
                <p>
                  Instead of managing symptoms, we look deeper to understand why your body is out of balance. By
                  connecting your history, lab data, and lifestyle, we identify the underlying patterns driving
                  fatigue, pain, inflammation, and autoimmunity.

                <p>
                  Our goal is to give you more than temporary relief — we give you clarity, direction, and a plan
                  that fits your life, all from the comfort of your home.
