              do not feel well. Our practice was created for them — for the people who know something deeper is
              going on and want a team who will finally take the time to understand it.

              While our mission explains why we do this work, functional medicine is how we do it. Our approach
              is straightforward: we look at how your body is functioning as a whole system. This helps us

            <p className="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-ink-soft">
              We take into account your history, your lab findings, your daily habits, and the way your systems
              interact with one another. This gives us a clearer picture of what your body needs and helps us
              create a plan that is targeted, practical, and built specifically for you.

            <p className="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-ink-soft">
